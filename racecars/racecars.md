# Racecars

The decompiled code in Ghidra pointed to the fact that it checks whether a given string is an anagram. So, I tried `./racecars sracecar` . However, this didn't work. <br>
Okay, so the only thing preventing racecars from being an anagram was the 's' at the end. So, from plural, I converted it to singular.<br> `./racecar` did the trick then.
